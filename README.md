# landing-page

My flexbox landing page project is divided into 5 different sections (header, three sections and a footer). I used all the knowledge I've gained from the TOP course so far. Also, I used semantic HTML as much as my knowledge allowed.

I very much enjoyed creating something from scratch as it was my very first time creating something on my own.
